# Kinetics and Inhibition of Beta-Galactosidase 
All data were collected at Dickinson College - Department of Chemistry

### I. Background
Beta-galactosidase (bGal) is an enzyme that cleaves polysaccharides containing galactose to liberate galactose; for instance, lactose is cleaved by bGal into glucose and galactose. In this experiment, kinetic properties of E. coli b-galactosidase with three different potential inhibitors, IPTG, L-arabinose, and theophylline were studied using hydrolysis of ONPG to release o-nitrophenol. 

### A. Types of Enzyme Inhibitors
Enzyme inhibitors can modulate enzyme activity by binding to specific sites on the enzyme, altering its ability to catalyze reactions. Inhibitors are broadly classified into three main types based on their binding mechanisms and effects on the kinetic parameters $V_{max}$ and $K_m$:

1. **Competitive Inhibitors**: bind to the enzyme’s active site, directly competing with the substrate (in this case, ONPG) for binding. This competition increases  $K_{m,app}$, as a higher substrate concentration is required to achieve half of $V_{max}$, reflecting reduced substrate affinity. However, $V_{max}$ remains unchanged because, at sufficiently high substrate concentrations, the substrate can outcompete the inhibitor, allowing the enzyme to reach its maximum velocity.
2. **Noncompetitive Inhibitors**: bind to a site on the enzyme other than the active site (an allosteric site), affecting the enzyme’s catalytic activity without interfering with substrate binding. This binding reduces the enzyme’s ability to catalyze the reaction, decreasing $V_{max,app}$, while $K_m$ typically remains unchanged because substrate binding is unaffected.
3. **Uncompetitive Inhibitors**: bind only to the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex, not the free enzyme, often at an allosteric site. This binding stabilizes the ES complex, reducing both $V_{max,app}$ and $K_{m,app}$. The decrease in $K_{m,app}$ reflects an apparent increase in substrate affinity, as the inhibitor traps the ES complex, while the decrease in $V_{max,app}$ indicates reduced catalytic turnover.
   
### B. Inhibitors Kinetics

The effects of these inhibitors were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk (double-reciprocal) and Michaelis-Menten (non-linear fitting) plots to determine changes in $V_{max}$ and $K_m$. The experiment aimed to classify each inhibitor based on the criteria: competitive inhibition is indicated by $K_{m,app} > K_m$ and $V_{max,app} \approx V_{max}$ (within 10% tolerance); noncompetitive inhibition by $V_{max,app} < V_{max}$ with unchanged $K_m$; and uncompetitive inhibition by $V_{max,app} < V_{max}$ and $K_{m,app} < K_m$.

### II. General procedures
#### a. Enzyme assay preparation
Each reaction set (performed in triplicate) contained 200 microliter solutions, included 50 microliter of ONPG as substrate solution (with varied concentrations), 50 microliter of reaction buffer (for uninhibited reaction) or potential inhibitor solution (IPTG/L-arabinose/theophylline), and 100 microliter of bGal solution. 
#### b. Characterizations
O-nitrophenol released from the reaction formed p-nitrophenolate ions, whose absorbance can be measured at 420 nm using UV-Vis spectrometry. Measurements were read every 45-60 seconds in around 7 minutes. Reaction rate (v) with substrate solutions of varied concentrations ([S]) were used to generate Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots  for kinectic analysis.
